Ethical AI Use in Healthcare: Policy Proposal
1. Patient Consent Protocols
Always obtain informed consent before collecting or using patient data.

Clearly explain how AI systems will use their data and decisions.

Allow patients to opt-out or withdraw consent anytime.

2. Bias Mitigation Strategies
Regularly audit AI models for bias related to race, gender, age, and other sensitive factors.

Use diverse and representative datasets during training.

Implement fairness-aware algorithms and continuous monitoring to reduce disparities.

3. Transparency Requirements
Ensure AI decisions are explainable and understandable to healthcare providers and patients.

Document AI system design, data sources, and limitations openly.

Provide clear channels for patients to ask questions or report concerns about AI-driven decisions.
