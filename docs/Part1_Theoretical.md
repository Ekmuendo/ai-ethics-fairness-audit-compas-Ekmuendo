# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (30%)

### Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.

Algorithmic bias occurs when AI systems produce unfair outcomes due to prejudiced assumptions present in the data or design. This can lead to discrimination against certain groups.

**Examples:**

- Facial recognition systems misidentify minorities at a higher rate than others.
- Hiring algorithms penalize female candidates because of biased historical data.

### Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?

- **Transparency** means knowing how an AI system works internally — including its data sources, algorithms, and decision logic.
- **Explainability** means the AI system can provide understandable reasons for its decisions to users.

Both are important because transparency builds trust and accountability, while explainability helps users understand, challenge, and trust AI decisions.

### Q3: How does GDPR impact AI development in the EU?

GDPR enforces strict data privacy and protection rules, requiring AI developers to:

- Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
- Practice data minimization (collect only what’s necessary).
- Allow users to access, correct, or delete their personal data.

This ensures AI respects user privacy rights and promotes responsible data handling.
